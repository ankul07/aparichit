## 🎬 Concept Overview

**Aparichit** is inspired by the iconic movie of the same name, where justice is served to those who escape the conventional legal system. This app provides a platform for people who are troubled by wrongdoers and feel helpless in seeking justice.

## 📖 Story Behind the App

The app is based on the journey of **Ambi**, a person who faces harassment and injustice from corrupt individuals but finds himself powerless to act. One day, he discovers a mysterious card containing a website link. Upon opening the link, he encounters **Aparichit** - a digital vigilante who promises justice according to the principles of **Garud Puran** (ancient Hindu scripture describing consequences for sins).

## ⚖️ Core Concept

### 🎯 The Philosophy

Aparichit targets individuals who:

- 🚫 **Don't understand humanity** and show no empathy towards others
- 💔 **Ignore the pain and suffering** of fellow human beings
- 🏛️ **Deceive the government** and indulge in corruption
- ⚠️ **Engage in immoral behavior** and wrongdoing
- 📋 **Don't perform their duties properly** (including government workers and officials)
- 💰 **Exploit their positions** for personal gain

### ✨ The Promise

Aparichit ensures that every wrongdoer receives punishment according to the **Garud Puran**, an ancient text that describes the consequences of one's actions (karma).

## 🔧 How the App Works

### 📍 Step 1: Initial Introduction

When a user accesses the website, Aparichit introduces itself with a powerful message:

> _"Those who don't understand humanity, those who don't understand the pain of others, those who deceive the government, those who engage in immoral conduct, those who don't do their work properly - whether government workers or anyone else - all such people will be punished by Aparichit according to the Garud Puran."_

### 📝 Step 2: Complaint Submission

The user is then prompted to provide details about the wrongdoer:

#### Required Information:

1. **What crime/wrongdoing was committed?**
   - Describe the offense in detail
2. **Identity of the wrongdoer:**
   - Name (if known)
   - Approximate age
   - Gender (Male/Female/Other)
   - Any other identifying information
3. **If exact details are unknown:**
   - Provide approximate information
   - Share whatever details are available
